For this assessment, you must create a public GitHub repository and work
within it, or start with a local Git repository and then transfer it to a public
GitHub repository that you create. Use your Keele email address for your
GitHub account and for your commits. Most of the assessment's marks
are for your use of Git and GitHub, rather than for your Python code.
With (or without) the help of a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, write a
game in Python. You might start with a prompt such as “write a simple
game in Python”, then add additional game feature(s) and “add a GUI”. It
is not intended that you spend long writing code for this assessment; your
code will only be looked at briefly to check that it is for a game. However,
you should commit regular versions of your code, and make at least some
use of branching and merging as you work on different features.
Submit a link to your public GitHub repository, i.e. the URL for its web
page, to the KLE drop-box for this assessment
